Cigarette Smoker Solution report


My solution for the semaphore version of the cigarette smoker problem uses a
semaphore for the agent and a semaphore array to keep track of the ingredients.
The agents starts the program by selecting an index in the semaphore array to indicate
that the ingredient associated with that index is not supplied. This would be similar
to the agent creating two ingredients that are available. After the ingredients
are created the agent increments the semaphore array only at the index of the missing
ingredient. This triggers the smoker with the missing ingredient to wake up and
create a cigarette to smoke. The agent sleeps until the cigarette has been created.
My solution does cause each smoker to wake up and check for the ingredients available
instead my solution wakes up only the smoker that is necessary to make the cigarette.
Since the semaphores prevents the race condition of acquire the ingredients and the agent
semaphore only wakes up the agent after the cigarette is created there is no risk of
loss of synchronization. Compared to Process', Pthreads would be more efficient because
they dont have the need to copy existing variables.
